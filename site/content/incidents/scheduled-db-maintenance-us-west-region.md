Starting at **7am PST today (3rd July 2019)**, we will be blocking write requests on both the content API and management API in the **US-WEST region**. This means that both content and schema changes won't be possible in that specific region. Read operations are still possible during the maintenance window. The maintenance is set to last not longer than one hour. 

Please reach out via our <a class="open_intercom">on-site chat</a> for any questions you might have!
