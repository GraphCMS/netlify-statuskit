We are investigating an issue with project creation not working. We will post an update as soon as we have more information.

**Update**: Our Asset Provider is having problems with their API, which affects our ability to create new projects. We are already in contact to resolve this asap. {{< track "2019-12-09T13:42:00.000Z" >}}

**Resolved**: Project creation is restores now. {{< track "2019-12-09T13:50:00.000Z" >}}
