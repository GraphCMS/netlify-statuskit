We will perform a short maintenance on our management API at 18:15 CEST . This shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. During that time, you won't be able to perform any schema changes. The Content APIs are not affected by this.

**Update:** The maintenance has started. {{< track "2020-05-26T16:15:00.000Z" >}}
