We are currently facing an issue causing some schema changes in the EU region resulting into a deployment error. Our Engineers are already looking into the issue!

**Update**: Some APIs seems to be affected by the issue, we are working on getting them back up asap. {{< track "2018-05-10T09:38:00.000Z" >}}

**Update**: It seems that our AWS database is affected by a general issue on AWS' side. See here for further information [https://status.aws.amazon.com/](https://status.aws.amazon.com/#EU_block) {{< track "2018-05-10T09:40:00.000Z" >}}
