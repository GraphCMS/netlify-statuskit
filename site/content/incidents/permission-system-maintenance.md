We are preparing a larger migration to introduce the ground work for upcoming features. For this we have to migrate all existing customer projects so they are able to use the new Permission Engine we already put in place. In the first step you wonâ€™t notice any differences, since the new permission system will work exactly the same from the outside. 

For the migration we need to stop write mutations on the management API for a short time, so no schema changes will be possible during this time window. 

**The migration will start today at 6pm CET** and will most likely take 2 hours. We will post updates on our status page accordingly.
