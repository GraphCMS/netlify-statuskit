We are seeing degraded performance in our EU_WEST_1 cluster. We are already in contact with our API provider to resolve this issue asap!

**Update** We are seeing increasing performance again. All EU APIs should be coming online again. We will continue to monitor our clusters. {{< track "2019-11-06T14:50:00.000Z" >}}
