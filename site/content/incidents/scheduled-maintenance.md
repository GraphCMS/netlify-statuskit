We will be performing a **scheduled maintenance** starting **3:30pm CET (6:30am PST)** on the GraphCMS webapp and backend.

During this time you might experience increased latency and intermittent connectivity issues. The webapp will also be switched into a maintenance mode, however the **Content API will remain online**.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
