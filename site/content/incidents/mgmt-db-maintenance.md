We will be performing a **scheduled maintenance** starting **08:00am CET** on the GraphCMS webapp and backend.

During this time you won't be able to use the webapp and mangement API, however the **Content APIs will remain online**.

The expected downtime will be around 10 minutes.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
