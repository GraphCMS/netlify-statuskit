We will be performing a **scheduled maintenance** starting **7:30pm CET (10:00am PST)** on the GraphCMS webapp and backend.

During this time you might experience increased latency and intermittent connectivity issues. The webapp will also be switched into a maintenance mode, however the **Content API will remain online**.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

**Update**: Maintenance has now ended! {{< track "2018-12-12T04:00:00.000Z" >}}
